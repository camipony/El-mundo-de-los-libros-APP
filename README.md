As a team we will make an app that helps solve your need in terms of e-commerce (simulated for the moment), user organization and news/events.

Technically these are the specifications of the project:

* Main microservices: user, payment, books and admin.
* For all interfaces React JS will be used.
* For the user microservice, firebase, mysql and express will be used.
* For the books microservice, firebase, mongodb, express, morgan and cors will be used
* The technologies for the payment and admin microservice still need to be defined

## Branches

* dev
  >_development branch where programmers must upload their changes that will be approved through a pull request.
  
* master
 >_main branch where only the correct changes will be allowed for merging

## Control environment code

*Git Flow* is ideal for projects that have a scheduled release cycle. This workflow does not add any new concepts or commands beyond those commonly used when working with Git (status, add, commit, checkout, merge, pull, and push). What it does do is assign very specific roles to different branches and define how and when they should interact.
